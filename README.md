This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.10.

## Description

This is a single-page application build using Angular that is connected to the [myFlix-backend](https://github.com/paulinemarg/myFlix-backend). Users are able to create an account and browse their favorite movies. They can modify account information, add or remove movies from their list of favorites, or delete their account.

## Technologies

This app is built using the MEAN stack of technlogies: 
> MongoDB
> 
> Angular 
> 
> Express.js
> 
> Node.js

## Design

I used angular material to design the app, such as: MatExpansion, MatDialog, MatSnackBar, MatToolbar, MatIcon, MatCard, etc...

## Setting up the tools:

Make sure you have Angular CLI installed globally. 

```
$ npm install --global @angular/cli@latest
```

After downloading the code, install the necessary modules by running:

```
$ npm install
```

## Development server

By default the app will run a local server on port: 4200

```
$ ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
